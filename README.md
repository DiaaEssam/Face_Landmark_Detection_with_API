# Facial Landmarks Detection

This project focuses on detecting facial landmarks using deep learning techniques. It utilizes a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the coordinates of various facial keypoints. The keypoints include the positions of eyes, nose, mouth, and other facial features.

## Introduction

The main goal of this project is to accurately detect and localize facial landmarks in images. It uses a combination of Python, TensorFlow, and Flask to build a web API for facial landmarks detection. The API provides endpoints for uploading images and receiving predictions for the facial keypoints.

## Installation

To set up the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/facial-landmarks-detection.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd facial-landmarks-detection`
3. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
4. Set up the Docker environment (optional): [Dockerfile](Dockerfile.txt) and [.dockerignore](.dockerignore.txt) files are provided for containerization.

## Usage

To use the facial landmarks detection API, follow these steps:

1. Start the Flask server: `python API.py`
2. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000`
3. Use an API testing tool like Postman to interact with the endpoints.

## Data

The project utilizes a dataset containing images and corresponding facial keypoints. The training dataset is stored in `training.csv`, and the test dataset is stored in `test.csv`. The images are represented as pixel values in a tabular format.

## Models

The project implements multiple CNN architectures for facial landmarks detection. The models are defined in the [face_landmarks_detection.py](face_landmarks_detection.py) file. Each architecture is trained using the training dataset and evaluated using the test dataset.

## Results

The performance of each trained model can be evaluated by analyzing the loss and accuracy metrics during training. Additionally, visualizations of the predicted facial keypoints on sample images are provided for better understanding.

## Contributing

Contributions to this project are welcome. If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, please open a new issue or submit a pull request. Your contributions will help enhance the accuracy and efficiency of facial landmarks detection.
